## 🧠 Types of Machine Learning

Machine learning algorithms are broadly categorized into:

- **Supervised Learning**
- **Unsupervised Learning**
- **Reinforcement Learning**

## 1️⃣ Supervised Machine Learning

Supervised learning involves training models on labeled datasets—where the outcome variable is known.

### 📌 Common Applications:
- Risk assessment
- Image recognition
- Predictive analytics
- Fraud detection
  
### 🔧 How It Works:
The model is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning each input has a known output. The algorithm learns the relationship between inputs and outputs to make predictions on new data.

### 📌 Real-Life Example:
**Email Spam Detection** – Emails are labeled as "spam" or "not spam." The model learns patterns from these labels to filter future emails.

### 🔍 Key Algorithms:

- **Regression Algorithms**  
  Predict continuous values (e.g., temperature, salary).  
  Examples: `Linear Regression`, `Random Forest`, `Gradient Boosting`

- **Classification Algorithms**  
  Predict categorical outcomes (e.g., spam detection).  
  Examples: `Logistic Regression`, `K-Nearest Neighbors`, `Support Vector Machines (SVMs)`

- **Naïve Bayes Classifiers**  
  Handle large datasets and model input distributions.  
  Includes: `Decision Trees` (used for both regression and classification)

- **Neural Networks**  
  Mimic brain-like processing for tasks like speech/image recognition and translation.

- **Random Forest Algorithms**  
  Combine multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy.

## 2️⃣ Unsupervised Machine Learning

Unsupervised learning draws insights from unlabeled data, ideal for exploratory analysis and pattern discovery.

### 📌 Common Techniques:
- Cluster analysis
- Dimensionality reduction
- Pattern recognition

### 🔧 How It Works:
The model is trained on data without labeled outputs. It identifies patterns, structures, or groupings within the data.

### 📌 Real-Life Example:
**Customer Segmentation** – Businesses group customers based on purchasing behavior to tailor marketing strategies.

### 🔍 Key Algorithms:

- **K-Means Clustering**  
  Groups data into K clusters based on proximity to centroids.  
  Used in: `Market segmentation`, `Document clustering`, `Image compression`

- **Hierarchical Clustering**  
  - *Agglomerative*: Starts with individual points, merges based on similarity  
  - *Divisive*: Starts with one cluster, splits based on differences

- **Probabilistic Clustering**  
  Groups data based on probability distributions (soft clustering)

> Unsupervised models power recommendation systems like “Customers who bought this also bought…”

## 3️⃣ Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning (RL), including RL from human feedback (RLHF), trains agents through reward and punishment systems.

### 📌 Common Uses:
- Video game AI
- Robotics
- Autonomous systems
  
### 🔧 How It Works:
An agent interacts with an environment, taking actions to achieve a goal. It receives rewards or penalties based on its actions and learns optimal strategies over time.

### 📌 Real-Life Example:
**Self-Driving Cars** – The car learns to navigate roads by receiving feedback on its driving decisions.

### 🔍 Key Algorithms:
- **Q-Learning** – Learns the value of actions in states to maximize rewards.
- **Deep Q Networks (DQN)** – Combines Q-learning with deep neural networks.
- **Policy Gradient Methods** – Directly optimize the policy that selects actions.
- **Monte Carlo Methods** – Learn from complete episodes of experience.
- **Temporal Difference (TD) Learning** – Combines ideas from Monte Carlo and dynamic programming.
